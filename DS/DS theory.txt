- Dictionary
Each key in dictionary will be separated by a colon (:)
Items are separated by comma (,)
Empty dictionary is written by {}
Keys must be a data type such as strings, numbers or tuples

- List 
List can be written by a lot of comma-separated items in square bracket
Items in list don't need to be the same type

- Hash table (quite same to dictionary)*
    Concept:
        A hash table is a data structure that implements a dictionary (also called an associative array). 
        It allows you to store key-value pairs and efficiently retrieve values based on their keys.

    Core Functionality:
        - Keys: Each entry in the hash table has a unique key that acts as an identifier for the associated value.

        - Hash Function: A hash function is a function that takes a key as input and generates a numeric index (hash value) 
                within a predefined range. This hash value is used to determine the location where the key-value pair 
                is stored in the hash table.

        - Table: The hash table is typically implemented as an array of slots. 
        Each slot can potentially hold a key-value pair.

- Tree 
There are 3 types of Tree
    - Binary Tree
    - Ternary Tree
    - Generic Tree
